Vim Friffle
---
An eye catching, yet simple theme for vim.

## Inspiration

I'm a huge fan of the [nord theme](nordtheme.com) for its relaxing color
palette. I'm also a fan of green themes such as homebrew on macOS for their
hommage to older days of computing. I wanted to try and bring the smoothness
of the nord theme to a theme which relied on green as it's base. I wanted my
theme to feel cohesive with my vim statusbar. Thus I also made a quite simple
vim lightline theme to complement friffle.

I have often found that Nord had some colors which were to similar to one
another and made syntax highlighting confusing at times. This is why I tried
my best to make all the  colors distinguishable from one another without being
too agressive. Behold, friffle-vim.

## Issues:

This is still a work in progress and I fix things when I have the time.  I
know other people use other bars such as airline and powerline. I am not
familiar with how these treat colors but if you wish to suggest it, please do
so. Feel free to submit pull requests. The better it gets, the better for
everyone!
