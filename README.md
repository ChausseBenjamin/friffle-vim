Vim Friffle
---
An eye catching, yet simple theme for vim.
Still a work in progress...

## Inspiration
I'm a huge fan of the [nord theme](nordtheme.com) for its relaxing color palette. I'm also a fan of green themes such as homebrew on macOS for their hommage to older days of computing. I wanted to try and bring the smoothness of the nord theme to a theme which relied on green as it's base.

I have often found that Nord had some colors which were to similar to one another and made syntax highlighting confusing at times. This is why I tried my best to make all the  colors distinguishable from one another without being too agressive. Behold, friffle-vim.

## Known Issues:
This is still a work in progress and I fix things when I have the time.

- [  ] Higlighting tab suggestions in command mode is waay too yello
